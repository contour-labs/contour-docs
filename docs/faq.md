\
#### Who has access to my documentation on Contour?

Contour inherits the access settings directly from your GitHub repository. If a member has read and write access in the corresponding repository, they will have the same level of access on Contour. If you have a private repository, no one will be able to see the documentation until they login as a collaborator on GitHub.

\
#### Why is Contour asking for write access to my repository?

Contour needs write access to ensure that your codebase stays in sync with changes in Contour. As protecting user privacy and data is our highest priority, Contour will never author or make changes without an authenticated user on your team.

\
#### Do I lose my documentation if I stop using Contour?

No! Since your documentation is stored inside your GitHub repository as Markdown files, you will always own your documentation.

\
#### How is my documentation site dynamic?

Unlike static documentation site generators like Jekyll or Docusaurus, Contour allows you to write documentation directly and what you see on the editor is instantaneously live. There's no need to set up CI/CD or deploy configurations since you make your changes right on the platform.

\
#### Can I try Contour before paying?

Yes! Contour offers the first month free.

\
#### Does Contour offer support?

Yes! Contour offers 24/7 phone, email, and Zoom support for every paying customer.

\
#### I have another question that's not answered here. How can I get my answer?

Just shoot us an email atÂ [support@contour.so](mailto:support@contour.so).
