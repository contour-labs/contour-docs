# What is Contour


---

\
**Contour** makes it easy for developers to write documentation that **always stays up to date**.

\
Because Contour treats **documentation like code**, developers can read, write, and merge docs all from your **GitHub Repository.** This means that updates to documentation can be **fast** and **seamlessly integrated** into developersâ€™ existing workflows.
