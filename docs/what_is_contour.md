## 2. Create a new Pull Request

Once created, Contour will automatically create and deploy a documentation site for your repository at `docs.contour.so/owner/repo`

Our PR bot will also provide a link to your documentation so you can get to your docs in a single click!

## 3. Write, Save, and Merge!

Use our WYSIWYG editor to write, save, and merge documentation. Contour stores your documentation as markdown files inside of your repo’s `docs/` directory.

\
Click the green “Save” button in the bottom right to save your draft.

Click the purple “Merge” button to merge your docs into your repo!
