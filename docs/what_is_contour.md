# What is Contour


---

\
**Contour** makes it easy for developers to write documentation that **always stays up to date**.

\
Because Contour treats **documentation like code**, developers can read, write, and merge docs all from your **GitHub Repository.**

This means that updates to documentation can be **fast** and **seamlessly integrated** into developersâ€™ existing workflows.

\

\
## With Contour, you can:

### Just write

* Write clean, readable documentation using our WYSIWYG editor.
* Use `/` slash commands to write different types of content!

### Keep knowledge centralized

* Stay in sync with GitHub.
* Review your documentation alongside your code.
