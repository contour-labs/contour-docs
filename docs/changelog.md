# Changelog

## January 24th

The past week has been focused on quality assurance and ensuring that the onboarding experience is smooth.

\
Some notable changes:

* **Automatic saving:** one of our complaints was that it was very tedious to have to constantly save our changes. To solve this problem, we implemented automatic saving to simplify the user flow.

* **Support for Private Repositories:** although we had this capacity before, we did not support private repositories because we wanted to be 1000% sure we did all the proper due diligence on the best practices.
* **5+ Integrations:** Weâ€™ve added integrations including Loom, Youtube, and Figma to our platform
* **Support for Merge Conflicts:** Thanks to [Sam](mailto:sam@contour.so), we can now resolve merge conflicts right from Contour. This isnâ€™t rolled out to all the repositories yet, but we plan to have it integrated by the end of the week.

## January 15th

* **Brand New Design:** the entire editor is revamped thanks to beautiful designs by [Charisa](mailto:charisa@contour.so) âœ¨. Weâ€™re excited by the new ergonomics and how itâ€™ll integrate into a more pleasant writing experience overall.
* **Branch support**: users can now toggle between various branches to see their documentation. This should integrate better with the pull request flow that users have, and we track the origin as well to ensure that your documentation is up-to-date.

\
* **File System Tracking:** your Contour sidebars will sync with your docs file directory. What this means is that we will generate a sidebar that corresponds to your `docs` directory and any changes on either side will correspond to the other side.

\
A simple example is dragging a Document into a Folder. If you insert `hi.md` inside folder `hello/`, this change in the sidebars will show up on your merge request as well.
